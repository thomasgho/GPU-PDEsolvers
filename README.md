# parallel-PDEsolvers

This repository gives detailed examples and tutorials on various high-performance techniques to solve PDEs. In particular, it aims to showcase Numba and CUDA acceleration as a tool to tackle common PDE problems encountered in mathematics, physics and engineering. It compares the performance of CPU and GPU implemented solvers.

Each notebook is self contained and explains in detail the problem at hand and how to solve it.

### Requirements
- numba == 0.50
- numpy
- scipy
- matplotlib
